I promised I'd attempt something in C# since I haven't had experience
with it yet.  So, in order to show something involving classes and 
object oriented constructs, I've got the following:

- Multiple Classes using inheritence from a base class
- generic lists on the base class, with class type checking, object 
  casting, and list iteration
- regular expressions

This is a simple program that initiates a list of derived employees (boss 
and programmer).  Each objects has some attributes that are set, and I
iterate through the list, changing or printing out certain attributes.
